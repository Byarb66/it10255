### Client - Server Architecture
A client-server architecture is the structure of a computer network where many clients can send and receive information from a host computer. Github fits into this category since many people can work on a project and github also acts as a database.

Cloud computing is the use of a network of servers to store data that can be accessed remotely from different devices. An example of cloud computing is Microsoft 365. Microsoft is a group of many different applications and cloud storage programs that help send and receive data to many different places.
